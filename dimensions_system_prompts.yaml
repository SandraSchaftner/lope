          <input>Title: "Quantitative Geochemical Mapping of Ammonium Minerals in the Southern Cedar Mountains, Nevada, Using the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)", Abstract: "Imaging spectrometer (hyperspectral) data, field spectral measurements, and laboratory analyses were used to quantitatively map the concentration of mineral-bound ammonium (buddingtonite) in hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks in the southern Cedar Mountains, Esmeralda County, Nevada. Mineral-bound ammonium is a product of ion exchange in silicate minerals and has no visible distinguishing characteristics, however, diagnostic infrared spectral features are ideal for identification using both field and airborne/spaceborne spectrometers. Establishment of a laboratory- or field-based geochemical calibration is presently a prerequisite to quantitative mapping. For this study, ammonium content of rock samples was determined by chemical analysis and reflectance spectra were measured on whole-rock samples. A linear relation was found between ammonium concentration and the depth of a 2.12 μm ammonium absorption feature in buddingtonite. An image-map of ammonium concentration in ppm was derived from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data by applying the linear calibration to the AVIRIS reflectance-calibrated spectrum at each pixel. Field spectral measurements, made with a PIMA field spectrometer on a 40 m grid, were used to create a ground-truth concentration map that confirmed the AVIRIS results. Field mapping, X-ray diffraction, and petrologic studies performed in conjunction with the AVIRIS analysis show that buddingtonite is the dominant ammonium mineral in the southern Cedar Mountains, that the ammonium is located along northeast-trending basin and range normal faults, and that it is restricted to two of four crystal-rich rhyolitic tuff units of Oligocene age. This study establishes that remote geochemical mapping using imaging spectrometer data is possible, and presents a methodology that could be extended to quantitatively map other minerals that have absorption features in the short-wave infrared."</input>

The two objective functions of the presented model seek to minimize the total cost and the maximum unmet demand. We depart from the existing literature by considering products’ shelf-life, substitutability and quantity discount, while addressing uncertainties in costs and demand. In doing so, a novel robust possibilistic optimization approach is introduced and its performance is analyzed. Finally, a case study is provided and its proposed optimal network is discussed."</input>

Data publication has emerged as a game-changing breakthrough in scholarly communication. Data form the outputs of research but also are a gateway to new hypotheses, enabling new scientific insights and driving innovation. And yet stakeholders across the scholarly ecosystem, including practitioners, institutions, and funders of scientific research are increasingly concerned about the lack of sharing and reuse of research data. Across disciplines and countries, researchers, funders, and publishers are pushing for a more effective research environment, minimizing the duplication of work and maximizing the interaction between researchers. Availability, discoverability, and reproducibility of research outputs are key factors to support data reuse and make possible this new environment of highly collaborative research. An interoperable e-infrastructure is imperative in order to develop new platforms and services for to data publication and reuse. DataCite has been working to establish and promote methods to locate, identify and share information about research data. Along with service development, DataCite supports and advocates for the standards behind persistent identifiers (in particular DOIs, Digital Object Identifiers) for data and other research outputs. Persistent identifiers allow different platforms to exchange information consistently and unambiguously and provide a reliable way to track citations and reuse. Because of this, data publication can become a reality from a technical standpoint, but the adoption of data publication and data citation as a practice by researchers is still in its early stages. Since 2009, DataCite has been developing a series of tools and services to foster the adoption of data publication and citation among the research community. Through the years, DataCite has worked in a close collaboration with interdisciplinary partners on these issues and we have gained insight into the development of data publication workflows.
